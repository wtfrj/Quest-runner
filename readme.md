# Discord Quest Auto-Completion Selfbot

A selfbot that automatically completes **Discord Quests**.

This project provides a minimal selfbot framework built on top of discord.js core libraries, demonstrating how selfbot patches can be implemented without modifying the library’s source code directly.

> [!CAUTION]
> As of April 7th 2026, Discord has expressed their intent to crack down on automating quest completion.

### You're all set! After completing these steps, the bot will automatically run every day at **00:15 UTC**. If you want to run it manually, you can still trigger the workflow yourself from the Actions tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On forked repositories, scheduled workflows can be automatically disabled after a long period of inactivity (especially on public repositories).
>
> If the schedule does not run, re-enable the workflow in the **Actions** tab and push a tiny commit to your default branch (for example, a small README typo fix) to wake the scheduler.
